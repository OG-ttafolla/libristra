A few notes regarding compilers.

We have compiled Atomics examples and tests with four compilers:

   clang++
   g++
   icc (Intel) on Darwin
   pgc++ (Portland Group) on Darwin

At the moment, pgc++ has some link errors for examples and tests that use
std::thread, so we're excluding those in the compile/run scripts for pgc++.
